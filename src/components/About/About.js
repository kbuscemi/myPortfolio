                    <span>Iâ€™m a full stack web developer working primarly with MERN stack and JavaScript. 
                        Prior to becoming a web developer I was working in the event industry as a Community Manager. 
                        When I first started developing web applications I looked at it as more of a hobby but it quickly 
                        became a passion of mine. Currently I am working on building another full stack MERN application that replicates 
                        a typical ecommerce website.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        When I'm not developing I'm either reading, exploring nature, or traveling the world. It was during my backpacking trip
                        through Europe and Southeast Aisa that I was able to capute the pictures you see on my homepage!
